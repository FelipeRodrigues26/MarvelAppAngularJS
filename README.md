# AngularJS Marvel World Catalog Tutorial App


## Prerequisites

### Git

- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here][git-setup].
- You can find documentation and download git [here][git-home].

### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node].
- Install the tool dependencies: `npm install`


## Workings of the Application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed][angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application. Instead we fake the
  application server by fetching static JSON files.
- Read the _Development_ section at the end to familiarize yourself with running and developing
  an AngularJS application.
